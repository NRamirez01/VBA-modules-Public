These modules represent my efforts to lower the amount of manual effort that is put toward document control. 


Update OOR is a tool I made for the head of our facility to update the customer open order forms based on his in-house documentation and eliminated the need to cross-reference the two sheets and transfer information manually.

Update Checksheets and Update IP are similar tools. Checksheets are what machinists use on the floor to ensure the parts coming off the machine are in tolerance and IP sheets are the "in process" inspection sheets that we use in Quality Control when the parts come to us. Both of these modules allow for a single SKU in a family to be the basis for the documents for every other SKU, this is something that is not in itself unique, however the difference is these modules act as a centralized tool to create as many SKUs' documents(with adjustments where SKUs differ) as necessary without having to do any copy and pasting by hand.

The Update IP to New Customer Standards was the first module I created that was used to update the formatting of the IP documents of nearly 1,500 SKUs, this was done due to changes requested by the customer and was something my supervisor was prepared to do by hand.



These tools are unique to the format of the sheets used at Elite Medical and are being shown here without any confidential company information attached. I do have permission to showcase these modules and demonstrate their function to interested parties.
